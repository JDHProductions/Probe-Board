# JDH Probe - Board

The *JDH Probe* is an ongoing project to create a printer-agnostic DIY bed probing solution for FDM printers. 
The board is currently designed as a drop-in replacement for the factory FLSUN leveling module, but we hope to extend the board's capabilities 
(such as adding ADXL345 support) and to make it a viable option for hobbyists and DIYers alike. 

## Board Housing

The FLSUN clone housing for the board can be found on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/168637-flsun-delta-probe-housing). 

This housing uses all the same hardware as the factory probe, they are listed below:
- 4x M2x4 Screws
- 1x M3x8 Screw
- 1x Probe Board 

_Note: The factory probe uses all self-tapping screws. These are not required to be self-tapping_
